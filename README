bios_dev_name

bios_dev_name in its simplest form takes an kernel name name as an
argument, and returns the BIOS-given name it "should" be.  This is necessary
on systems where the BIOS name for a given device (e.g. the label on
the chassis is "Gb1") doesn't map directly and obviously to the kernel
name (e.g. eth0).

The distro-patches/sles10/ directory contains a patch needed to
integrate bios_dev_name into the SLES10 udev ethernet naming rules.

This also works as a straight udev rule.  On RHEL4, that looks like:

KERNEL=="eth*", ACTION=="add", PROGRAM="/usr/sbin/bios_dev_name -i %k", NAME="%c"
